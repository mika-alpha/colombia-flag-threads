This code uses threads, ansi and console virtual terminal sequences to "draw" a Colombia's flag.

The code won't work if your windows 10 doesn't have the reg key for the ansi characters enabled, of if you don't use a console emulator that reads them.

Here are some screenshots of it drawing the flag.
